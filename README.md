# Norwegian Loan Calculator

## Pre-history

I encountered with situation that some from my friends take loans from Norwegian banks.
It is a little bit hard to calculate loan properly. Therefore, I create a small command-line to calculate different banks conditions and offers. I have used as a main parameters total credit sum, monthly payment, yearly percentage, monthly payment fee.

## How to install?

The code is compatible with both `Python2`/`Python3`. In order to run it, you need to install python and run code as `python credit_calculator.py` changing parameters based on the loan.
